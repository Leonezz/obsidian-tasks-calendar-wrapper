![Obsidian Downloads](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?logo=obsidian&color=%23483699&label=downloads&query=%24%5B%22tasks-calendar-wrapper%22%5D.downloads&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fobsidianmd%2Fobsidian-releases%2Fmaster%2Fcommunity-plugin-stats.json)

This plugin currently provides a timeline view to display your tasks from your [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) valut, with customizable filters and renderring options.

## Overview

The [ExampleValut](https://github.com/Leonezz/obsidian-tasks-calendar-wrapper/tree/master/ExampleVault) provides an example using this plugin, the screen shot with the [Blue-Topaz](https://github.com/whyt-byte/Blue-Topaz_Obsidian-css) light theme is as follows:

![](imgs/overview.png)

## Features

- Organize taks in a timeline view
- Customizable options
- Quick entry panel for new items and filters

## About

This is a simple wrapper for Obsidian-Tasks-Calendar (https://github.com/702573N/Obsidian-Tasks-Calendar) and Obsidian-Tasks-Timeline (https://github.com/702573N/Obsidian-Tasks-Timeline).

This plugin provides setting pages and update support for [702573N](https://github.com/702573N)'s great work, for detailed information
about the options, see [Obsidian-Tasks-Calendar](https://github.com/702573N/Obsidian-Tasks-Calendar) and [Obsidian-Tasks-Timeline](https://github.com/702573N/Obsidian-Tasks-Timeline).

## Usage

goto command panel and find "Tasks Calendar Wrapper: Open Tasks Timeline View", select the command and the view will show up.

### Date format

For dates of an item, if the item belongs to a daily note, then the date of that daily note will be setted as the item's _created date_. Additionally, the start date and scheduled date will also be setted as to daily note date if these two dates are not otherwise given.

For general date format, it is recommend to use the [Tasks Plugin](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks)'s emoji format or the [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) format. Both are supported in this plugin.

For example, an item with 2023-06-03 as the start date could be:

- [ ] task that starts at 2023-06-03 üõ´ 2023-06-03

or:

- [ ] task that starts at 2023-06-03 [start::2023-06-03]

or in a daily note of date 2023-06-03:

- [ ] task that starts at 2023-06-03

## Installation

This plugin is available on the community market.

## Components

There are mainly two components in the timeline view, which are the quick entry panel and the content view.

### Quick Entry

The quick entry panel provides four buttons an one input line.
![](imgs/quick_entry.png)

#### Buttons

The four buttons are: Focus On Today, Todo, Overdue, and Unplanned. With Focus On Today button enabled, only task items that are under 'today's' part are going to be displayed, and the other three buttons 'Focus' or 'Filter' tasks with specific status with corresponding options.

#### Input line

With the input line you can append new task items to predefined sections in selected files, for example, you can append a new task to your 'Inbox' file:

![](imgs/newtask.png)

Just some details to make it easier, you can input in the panel with some of the [Tasks-Plugin](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) defined emoji format date, for example, you could input the word 'due' and a blank space, the emoji üìÖ will replace the word 'due'. The following word-emoji pairs are now available:

- due: üìÖ (for due date)
- start: üõ´ (for start date)
- scheduled: ‚è≥ (for scheduled date)
- done: ‚úÖ (for done date)
- highest: üî∫ (for priority highest)
- high: ‚è´ (for priority high)
- medium: üîº (for priority medium)
- low: üîΩ (for priority low)
- lowest: ‚è¨ (for priority lowest)
- repeat: üîÅ (for recurrence)
- recurring: üîÅ (same as repeat)

Besides, there are some natural language dates support:

- today/tomorrow/yesterday: expand to today/tomorrow/yesterday's date

Another functionality the input line provides is a quick filter, currently data range and priorities based filter are supported, hopefully a tag based filter will be added soon!

### Content

The content component are date-based, to be specific, the task items are organized with their dates. For each date, there could be a date header, and there could be a year head for each year.

#### Task Item Component

For a specific task item, this view displays the item content, status, priority, dates, filename and section (if exists), and the tags. Plus there is a button with a pencil icon to call the task edit modal of the [Tasks Plugin](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) out for editing.

The status are displayed in form of icons, and the other meta-data are displayed with icons and badges.

![](imgs/item.png)

Since v0.2.1, now you can switch from the builtin icons to theme defined status and icons!

Below is a screen shot with theme [AnuPpuccin](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin).
